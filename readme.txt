Add a multi-image metabox to your posts, pages and custom post types

== Description ==

This plugin add a metabox which allox to upload and link multiple images to one post.
Pictures are linked by the way of meta_value (and attachments ID). They can be reordered using drag and drop.

Number of allowed pictures and concerned post types can be overited using hooks.

Plugin includes many functions to retrieve linked pictures.
For more information on using the plugin, refer to the section ["Other Notes"](/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the Multi Image Metabox plugin to your blog and Activate it.

2. Customize (into the functions.php file of your theme):

	1. If you want to target other post type than PAGE, [use the filter hook "images_cpt"](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/#Set-concerned-post-types)
	2. If you want to change the number of image, [use the filter hook "list_images"](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/#Set-allowed-number-of-picts) 

3. Retrieve the linked images in your theme using the functions :

	1. [Use get_images_ids()](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/#get_images_ids()) into the loop to get an array of attachment's ID
	2. [Use get_images_src('size')](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/#get_images_src()) into the loop to get an array of attachment's URI & dimensions for  the quiered size 
	3. [Use get_multi_images_src('size1','size2')](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multi-image-metabox/other_notes/#get_multi_images_src()) into the loop to get an array of attachment's URI & dimensions for 2 differents size

4. Enjoy ^^ (report to developper section to view the returned datas)

== Set concerned post types ==

Paste this into your theme's functions.php file :
`<?php
	add_filter('images_cpt','my_image_cpt');

			'image1' => '_image1',
			'image2' => '_image2',
		);
		return $picts;
	}

= Set allowed number of picts, depending to the post_type =

Paste this into your theme's functions.php file :
`add_filter('list_images','my_list_images',10,2);
function my_list_images($list_images, $cpt){
	global $typenow;
    if($typenow == "my_custom_post_type" || $cpt == "my_custom_post_type")
	    $picts = array(
